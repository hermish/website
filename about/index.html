    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        I grew up in Canada, a chapter of my life which came to an end recently, but only after I had the privilege of representing my country at the fourty-nineth International Chemistry Olympiad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this journey, I discovered my love for computer science through computational chemistry and the algorithms which model quantum systems. Iâ€™m passionate about making computer science more accessible, inviting different backgrounds, experiences and disciplines, including chemistry, into the field. My current research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, psychology, cognitive science, and education, using computation to better understand and model human behavior.
