<p>I’m a first year Computer Science and Engineering (EECS) student at the University of California, Berkeley. My site is permanently under construction, but currently more so than usual.</p>

<p>I discovered my love for computer science through computational chemistry and the algorithms which model quantum systems. I’m passionate about making computer science more accessible, inviting different backgrounds, experiences and disciplines, including chemistry, into the field. Don't hesitate to reach out to me!</p>
