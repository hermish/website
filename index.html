<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I discovered my love for computer science through computational chemistry and the algorithms which model quantum systems. I’m passionate about making computer science more accessible, inviting different backgrounds, experiences and disciplines, including chemistry, into the field. My <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~hermish/files/documents/Resume.pdf" title="Resume">resume</a> is here, along with my <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~hermish/files/portfolio/" title="Portfolio">portfolio</a>, if you wanted to explore some of my work.</p>
