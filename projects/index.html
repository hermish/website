    <p> 
        As a Facilitated Study Group Leader for MAT 102 at the University of Toronto, I put together a <a href="../files/documents/Partial-Teaching-Notes.pdf" title="Partial Teaching Notes">short book</a> and developed a series of <a href="../files/documents/Teaching-Handouts.pdf" title="Teaching Handouts">teaching handouts</a>. I am currently working on making these more comprehensive.

        I recently worked on a project to analyze and visualize some of AirBnb's data about bookings in the bay area; you can see my first foray into making predictive models and building analytical web apps <a href="http://airbnb-optimization.herokuapp.com" title="AirBnB Optimization">here</a>. Looking back, I am also proud of some of the <a href="../files/documents/Graphic-Design.pdf" title="Graphic Design">graphic design</a> work I did in high school to raise money for Toronto-based food-rescue charity <a href="http://www.secondharvest.ca" title="Second Harvest">Second Harvest.</a> (I hope you find these at least slightly cute!)
