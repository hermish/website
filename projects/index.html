<p>My <a href="../files/documents/Resume.pdf" title="Resume">resume</a> is here, if you wanted a quick overview of my of my experience. As a Facilitated Study Group Leader for an introductory proofs course, I put together a <a href="../files/documents/Partial%20Teaching%20Notes.pdf" title="Partial Teaching Notes">short book</a> and developed a series of <a href="../files/documents/Teaching%20Handouts.pdf" title="Teaching Handouts">teaching handouts</a>. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/hermish" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> to see some of the projects I am currently working on and feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hermish/" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> for some more information about my background.</p>

<p>I am also happy with some the <a href="../files/documents/Graphic%20Design.pdf" title="Graphic Design">graphic design</a> work I did in high school to raise money for Toronto-based food-rescue charity <a href="http://www.secondharvest.ca" title="Second Harvest">Second Harvest</a>; I hope you find these at least slightly cute.</p>
