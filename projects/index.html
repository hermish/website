        As a Facilitated Study Group Leader for an introductory proofs course, I put together a <a href="../files/documents/Partial%20Teaching%20Notes.pdf" title="Partial Teaching Notes">short book</a> and developed a series of <a href="../files/documents/Teaching%20Handouts.pdf" title="Teaching Handouts">teaching handouts</a>. I am currently working on making these more comprehensive, mostly for my own sake.

        I'm currently doing research in Tom Griffiths' Computational Cognitive Science lab, analyzing real-world big data to draw insights about what drives curiosity; some interesting snapshots of our work are available <a href="https://github.com/hermish/cocosci-research" title="Data">here</a>.

        I recently worked on a project to analyze and visualize some of AirBnb's data about bookings in the bay area; you can see my first foray into making predictive models and building analytical web apps <a href="http://airbnb-optimization.herokuapp.com" title="AirBnB Optimization">here</a>. Looking back, I am also proud of some of the <a href="../files/documents/Graphic%20Design.pdf" title="Graphic Design">graphic design</a> work I did in high school to raise money for Toronto-based food-rescue charity <a href="http://www.secondharvest.ca" title="Second Harvest">Second Harvest.</a> (I hope you find these at least slightly cute!)
