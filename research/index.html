    <h1>Research</h1>

    <p>
        I'm currently doing research in Professor Tom Griffiths' Computational
        Cognitive Science lab and Professor Tania Lombrozo's Concepts and
        Cognition lab, at the intersection of computer science, psychology,
        and cognitive science. Our current work involves analyzing real-world
        big data to draw insights about what drives curiosity.

    <p>
        This summer I am also studying approximation algorithms in semi-random
        graphs, attempting to improve current algorithms found in the
        literature. Below is a list of publications; asterisks indicate
        equal contribution.

            Dubey, R.*, &amp; Lombrozo, T. (2018). Your liking is my curiosity: a
            social popularity intervention to induce curiosity. Submitted to
            the <i>40th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.</i>
